This book personally helped me quite a bit and still utilize some of the concepts I learned in this book today. Fundamentally this book is just what it says, it tells you how, exactly, to stop being a nice guy once and for all. But it is much more than that. It’s about regaining self-respect for yourself, setting boundaries, becoming comfortable with your sexuality and not caring what other people think about you.

It’s also very interesting to see some of the behaviors that “nice guys” often do which are passive aggressive and not very nice at all. Many nice guys take pride in being white knights and gentlemen, but often they are bitter and self-serving, utilizing manipulation instead of directly asking for what they want.

  * What is a nice guy?
    * Give, fixer, care-taker- approval seeker and conflict avoider, more comfortable with women, want to be different than their fathers
    * Some of the bad traits
      * Dishonest, saying what he believe people want to hear
      * Hides true intentions and motives
      * Manipulates instead of asking directly
      * Controlling
      * Gives only to get, gets frustrated when not appreciated
      * Passive aggressive, full of rage
      * Can’t set boundaries and say “no”
  * Toxic shame: the idea that you are unlovable and you must do things to be loved
    * Caretaking
      * Satisfaction from giving
      * Emptiness in giver
      * Unconscious strings attached
  * Caring
      * Helping others
      * Abundance
      * Unconditional
  * Feminism partly created this problem because women raised men and dads weren’t around as much due to the world wars and it propagated since.
  * Please yourself first
  * Ok to be a little bit selfish
  * Put your needs first
  * Stop avoiding conflict, because you avoid resolution
  * Spend more time with masculine men
  * Don’t settle for bad sex
  * Set clear boundaries and enforce them
  * Covert contracts: implying that if I do this for you, you’ll do this for me. Usually with sexual favors. Women see right through it and it is pathetic. Instead be overt and say what you want.
    * ““If I’m a good guy then I will be liked and loved, and the people I want to have sex with, will want to have sex with me”
    * “If I meet other people’s needs without them having to ask, then they will meet my needs without me having to ask”
    * “If I do everything right, then I will have a smooth problem free life”
