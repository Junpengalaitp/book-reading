* 4 core values
  * Strength
    * Men are physically stronger than women.
    * A man that lacks strength will be less respected by other men.
    * A weak man will be despised.
  * Mastery
    * Men are judged by the skills they offer the tribe.
    * Having a high degree of mastery makes you valuable to your peers and tribe.
  * Courage
    * A man who is afraid to take risks for the gang is a man that can’t be relied on.
    * Men are judged by courage, women are not.
    * A man who lacks courage makes the tribe more vulnerable to attack.
    * This does not mean to be rashly confident, but in a rational disregard for fear.
  * Honor
    * Your reputation and how you are perceived by other men is important.
    * Women are not concerned with honor.
    * his is tied to other elements such as strength, mastery and courage.
    * Reflexive: “Reflexive honour is the primitive desire to hit back when hit, to show that you will stand up for yourself.”
    * Cultural: “traditions, stories and habits of thought of a particular society about the proper and improper use of violence.”
    * Honor is hierarchical—status within the group.
* Men compete against each other for status.
* In the world today it is easy to be lost as a man, feeling society has no need for you.
* The way of men is the way of the gang.
  * You have to differentiate us from them.
  * Men are men within a group that belongs to the “us.”
* Masculinity is about being a man within a group of men. Above all things, masculinity is about what men want from each other.
* “It is not the strongest man who will necessarily lead, it is the man who takes the lead who will lead. This intragroup courage is required for a man to assert his interests over the interests of the other men in the group. At the most primal level requires a potential threat of violence. This is how men have always sized each other up, and this is how they size each other up today.”
* Masculine men have gravitas. They will be taken seriously.
* Solution: restart the world. Create gangs.
  * Gang - “a bonded, hierarchical coalition of males allied to assert their interests against external forces.”
