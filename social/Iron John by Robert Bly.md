* The Wild Man represents our unbridled masculinity and animal instincts. It also encompasses our dark side.
* The King immediately locks up the Wild Man. This is what we do by default. We all have a Wild Man inside us, but we stuff him down and lock him up because he is unacceptable to society and we are afraid of him.
* Around 8, we lose the Golden Ball, which represents our freedom and joy in life, free from the burdens of stress.
* At some point in our life, we decide to let the Wild Man out of the cage in exchange for the Golden Ball, but we need the key, which is controlled by our mother.
* This key represents the control and desire our parents have on us to keep us guarded and dependant on them instead of becoming a man.
* In other societies boy were taken from their mothers by other men of the tribe to become initiated into manhood.
  
* Today, we must find a way to perform that initiation ourselves by finding the Wild Man and disposing of the value systems of our parents along with their guilting, shaming and value judgement of us.
* In the story the boy is wounded. This wound represents our internal shame—which we must also deal with. We must go deep into the wound and go into a catharsis to reintegrate the wounded boy into our psyche. This wound is one of the reasons why we seek external validation.
* It is essential for us to find male mentors and our tribe to really graduate into becoming a man today.
* Our mothers tend to give us a bad view of our fathers. We must learn to shake that and discover for ourselves what it is to be a man to understand our fathers.
* Your biggest injury is likely caused by your father.
* The Wild Man is not a savage. He is more like a shaman.
* Do not be afraid to fight—especially in your relationships with women.
* A deep wound is necessary to progress to become a whole man. It can take many forms, but this wound is given later in life.
