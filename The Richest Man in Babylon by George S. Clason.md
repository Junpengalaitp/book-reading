* Save at least 10 percent of what you earn—pay yourself first.
* Do not let your living expenses go up with your increase in income. Necessary expenses should not be confused with desires.
* Create a reliable future income stream for yourself which does not require you to work.
* You must overcome procrastination to reach your full measure of success in life.
* Key lessons:
  * Pay yourself first.
  * Live within your means.
  * Make your money work for you.
  * Protect your wealth.
  * Make your home a profitable investment.
  * Secure your future income.
  * Invest in yourself.
  *Get luck on your side.
* The laws of money are like physical laws in the universe, they do not change.
* “It costs nothing to ask wise advice from a good friend.”
* Do not take financial advice from a bricklayer. Choose experts in a subject if you want expert advice.
* Surround yourself with people who are financially smart and making lots of money.
* Don’t go too far trying to save everything. You also have to enjoy life while you are here.
* Invest wisely. Make sure your investment is paying you something and do not invest in risky investments where you have no knowledge.
* “A man’s wealth is not in the coins in his purse. It is in his income.”
* Increase your ability to earn income by increasing your skills and investing in yourself.
* If you want to help a friend, don’t bring that person’s burdens onto yourself. Don’t do something that will restrict your time, money or energy.
* If you lend money, make sure you have some kind of guarantee of repayment.
* No man respects himself if he does not pay his debts.
* The soul of a free man looks at the world as a series of problems to be solved. Meanwhile, the soul of a slave whines, “What can I do?”
* If you are in debt, live on 70% of what you make. Save 10% for yourself. Use the remaining 20% to repay your debts. (I would argue a more aggressive debt reduction strategy based on how much the interest on the debt is.)
