* Man is the sum of his thoughts. Your actions will flow from your thoughts which is a reflection of who you are at any given moment in time.

* Over time the actions shape your character because they form patterns that define you.

* Changing your thoughts can change your actions and your character as a result.
  
* Start weeding out the bad thoughts. Clean your mind.

* External things that happen to you might influence you, but you ultimately are responsible and have put yourself in the situation through your thoughts and actions.

* What you think can influence your health and wellbeing, so be careful.

* “Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself”

* “Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are.”

* “Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound.”

* “He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly.”

* Your mind is like a garden. Your thoughts are what you plant. Your actions are what you reap.

* Suffering is always the effect of wrong thought in some direction.

* “As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and patient training, so the man of weak thoughts can make them strong by exercising himself in right thinking.”
