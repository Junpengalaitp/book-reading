This book was written by Tim Grover who was the coach for Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and other great basketball legends and athletes.

The primary focus on this book is defining what it means to be relentless. Very similar to what we’d describe the Bulldog Mindset.

The book is about the differences between what Tim calls coolers, closers and cleaners. Cleaners being the most relentless and successful people and athletes who thrive on victory itself not on what victory gives them as a reward.

  * Relentless and unstoppable people are cleaners. Ultimate competitor who isn’t satisfied with just trying or giving their best.
  * Coolers are good. Closers are great. Cleaners are unstoppable.
    Take responsibility for EVERYTHING in your life. It doesn’t matter if it’s your responsibility or your fault, you own it anyway.
  * Get rid of all excuses. Say when you’ve screwed up. Own it.
    Push yourself. Every day challenge yourself to be uncomfortable.
  * You grow by pushing your boundaries and expanding them.
  * Don’t wait to be asked, just do what needs to be done.
  * Don’t study the competition, be so good that your competition studies you.
  * Cleaners trust their guy because they’ve developed the instinct from hours and hours of practice.
  * Cleaners never feel they’ve achieved success because there is always more to do.
  * We all have a dark side. We have to embrace and handle the dark side to fuel us.
  * Stay cool and calm, don’t get emotional. Just do what needs to be done.
  * Don’t require congratulations or accolades, do the good job because that is what you do.
  * Tell people straight to their face what you think, whether they like it or not.
  * When a cleaner speaks, you believe. Speak with conviction.
  * Keep pushing yourself harder when everyone else has had enough.
  * Physical dominance will make you great, mental dominance will make you unstoppable.
  * There is no off switch. You are always on.
  * When you are in the zone you don’t think, just act.
  * Emotions make you weak, there are no emotions in the zone.
  * Don’t be intimidated by pressure, thrive on it.
  * Your level of success is determined by how well you embrace and handle stress.
  * Don’t apologize for your success, expect people to get on your level or out of your way.
  * You have to learn to trust your gut.
  * There are no shortcuts and there is no luck.
  * Hard work is not a skill, anyone can do it.
  * Refuse to recognize failure. Find another way.
  * You can’t be relentless unless you are willing to take chances.
  * Demand more of yourself than anyone else could ever demand of you.
