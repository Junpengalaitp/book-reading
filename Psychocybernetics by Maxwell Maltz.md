This is one of the most fundamental books that teaches you exactly how to transform yourself by starting with your mind and self-image. Dr. Maxwell Maltz was a plastic surgeon who noticed that sometimes when he performed surgery on some of his patients that their personalities would change after the surgery, but for other patients it would remain the same. He discovered that the difference was whether or not the surgery affected their self-image.

Once Dr. Maltz realized that was the case, he unlocked the secret to changing yourself, changing your self-image.

* We all believe certain things about ourselves. They aren’t necessarily true, but out interpretations of the events that have happened to us and a reflection of how other people have responded to us in the past.
The story you tell about yourself directly affects how you act.
* We all created a mental image of ourselves from past events, that mental image of our selves or our self-image can not be violated, so we always end up acting in accordance with it.
* Our brains contain a goal seeking mechanism that operates like a course correcting heat seeking missile. Whatever we focus on as a goal, our brain will steer us towards.
  * Our nervous system can’t tell the difference between real experiences and those we imagine, so our system will react to what we believe to be true.
  * You could be training your brain to re enforce negative behaviors.
  * You can actually improve your skills through mental practice alone.
* We are hypnotized by negative beliefs, but we can overcome those beliefs with rational thinking.
  * Change your negative beliefs by asking why.
  * Find inconsistencies in your negative beliefs. Is it really true that ALL women find you unattractive?
* We can CHOOSE to be happy by choosing to focus on positive thoughts and letting go of negative ones.
  * No one makes you mad, you choose to interpret events in such a way that allows you to be angry.
  * You can make a decision to allow things to affect you negatively or not.
* Seven elements for a successful personality:
  * Sense of direction
  * Understanding
  * Courage
  * Charity

* Remove your emotional scars by rewriting your memory.
  * Literally remember things but see them from a different view with a different interpretation and you’ll restore them with positive associations.
  * Practice disinhibition, by not thinking before you speak.
* Use relaxation techniques to achieve a peaceful state of mind.
