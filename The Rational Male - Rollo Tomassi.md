This is one of the essential books all men should read to understand female nature and become red pilled. Rollo is a friend of mine and I agree with most of what he said in this book, but I do feel it is a bit jaded, so be careful not to go too far down the rabbit hole with this one. Read this book with the objective viewpoint that everything described here is not wrong or bad, but just is.

The book mostly focuses on dispelling the “blue pilled” fallacy of the romantic, fairy tale ideals of love and relationships Here are some important points:

* There is no “the one.” The soulmate myth is a destructive one that produces oneitis.
* Do not obsess over a single woman. No woman is so special that she’s the only one for you.
* Power in a relationship goes to the individual who needs the other the least.
* Just be yourself is terrible advice. Instead, grow and become something better.
* Plate theory. Date multiple women at the same time and don’t commit to any of them until you are at least 30 or possibly even later.
* Your sexual market value of a man will peak somewhere around 35-40. While a woman’s will peak around 23.
* Spinning several plates is about the abundance mindset. You’ll be able to care less if you have other options.
* Women would rather share a successful man than be saddled with a faithful loser.
* You must become the prize to be able to be a man women will accept non-exclusivity with.
* Red Pill Awakening Stages:
  * Denial
  * Anger
  * Bargaining
  * Depression
  * Acceptance
* Men’s sexual market value is based on more than looks which is why men have an advantage over time.
* Women are told they have plenty of time, which is a losing strategy for them.
* To keep a woman’s interest don’t be too available, show that you have other options from your behavior and don’t necessarily be there for her on weekends.
* Women will give you shit tests to determine:
  * Confidence
  * Options
  * Security
* The “Alpha Buddha” Corey Worthington
  * Have to disagree with Rollo on this one. He’s not even close to alpha. Watch for yourself.
  * Rollo’s point though is that alpha is about doing what you want and not giving a fuck.
* Iron rules:
  * Frame is everything
  * Never share your sexual partner count
  * Don’t wait for women who make you wait
  * Don’t live with a woman you aren’t marrying
  * Never allow a woman to be in control of birth control
  * Women are incapable of loving a man the way he expects
  * Develop new relationships, don’t fix broken ones
  * Never help a woman figure out why she won’t fuck you
  * Neve self-deprecate
