* About 70% of your tendency to gain weight is determined by your parents / genetics.
* Humans throughout evolution were selected for leanness rather than obesity. The problem is the modern diet and the high prevalence of sugar.
* Calories in has a large effect on calories out. That is why the measurement isn’t so simple. It also depends on the type of calories.
* Different calories also have a different response within the body. Some types of food will raise insulin which will lead to fat storage (since insulin is an anabolic hormone.) Other foods do not raise insulin as much.
* One of the reasons calories aren’t the only thing that matters is because the body will reduce calorie burn by decreasing energy use in other systems: body heat, hair and nail growth, strength and endurance and heart stroke volume.
* Weight loss is 95% diet.
* Being fat actually causes you to eat more and throws off your hormonal balance which makes it that much harder to lose weight.
* Excess insulin secretion is one of the main causes of obesity. (Which is caused by being fat.)
* The longer you are fat, the harder it is to lose weight because of body setpoints.
* Insulin resistance is a cycle. The more you are resistant, the more your body produces, which makes you more resistant.
* There are many myths around meal frequency and especially breakfast. Eating more meals does not increase metabolism. In fact, eating frequently results in persistently high insulin levels which increase insulin resistance.
* Type 2 diabetes is just very high insulin resistance, which is caused by high levels of insulin over time.
* Removing all added sugars from your diet is one of the best ways to combat insulin resistance and lose weight.
* Vinegar can help to blunt the glycemic index of foods, resulting in less insulin resistance.
* Eating fat doesn’t make you fat. It might even help you avoid getting fat.
* The low-fat diet plan has been empirically proven to fail.
* To reduce weight, eat mostly whole, unprocessed foods, avoid sugar, eat more of your calories from fat (natural fats.)
* Fasting is one of the best ways to heal many conditions and has been practiced through societies since the beginning of humanity.
* Fasting can work with any diet.
* Fasting actually preserves muscle mass and reduces insulin levels.
* Fasting is a good time to exercise.
