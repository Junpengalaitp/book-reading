* History was shaped by demanding situations, not necessarily great men. Essentially men acted heroic in many situations because the situation necessitated it.
* We are the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with. We’re also the average of the 5 people our 5 friends spend time with.
* It’s not free will or determinism, but each person has a contextual agency.
* You have the ability to choose or design your environment to a large degree and your environment largely influences your behavior.
* Precognition: Personality is shaped by behavior. Alter your identity by altering your behavior.
* Change is inevitable. Growth is optional. You are evolving right now.
* Environment shapes your behavior more than you think. Most behaviors are outsourced to environment. Do something enough times in the same place and it becomes automatic.
* Social norms control your behavior more than your deepest desires and ideologies.
* Your identity is relative to your environment. It is not fixed.
* Peak experiences and peak state can help you to make good decisions and have clarity about your life and goals. This requires regular rest. Make powerful decisions outside of your routine environment.
* Use a morning routine and a daily environment to trigger you to stay on course.
* Eliminate and remove things from your life that conflict with your decisions. Subtraction is productivity. Get rid of distractions or anything else that will go against what you are trying to accomplish. Create the ideal environment for the work you want to do.
* Make your positive choices automatic by shaping your environment and premaking decisions. Make it easier to make the right decisions. (One way I do this is through creating rules for myself that I never break.)
* Create automated responses for dealing with situations. When I feel like this or I do this I will do that instead. Plan for the worst. Addictions must be replaced, the void must be filled.
* Use forcing functions to force your behavior. For example, leaving your phone in the car at dinner so you can’t check it. Public accountability works well here too.
* Life lessons are repeated over and over again until they are learned.
* Commit 100% to the changes you seek.
* Adapting to a new behavior: you can do it slowly, but that extends pain. If you commit 100% and jump fully in, you’ll adapt quickly after an immediate high level shock. Purging can hurt.
* Compete higher than your skill level to grow into your goals.
* Create high pressure environments that force you to reach your goals. (Signing up for a group fitness class that is really tough is one way to do this.)
* Change your environment to match the work you are doing.
* Change your world by changing who you work with.
