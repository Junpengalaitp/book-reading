  * Living well today by borrowing from tomorrow. YOLO baby!
  * Believe debt is an asset which lets them buy more stuff
  * Value spending over saving… instant gratification.
  * Paycheck to paycheck.
* Slowlane Wealth: Wealth = Job + Market Investments
  * Sacrificing today for the better future. (Mediocrity)
* Fastlane Wealth: Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value
  * Net Profit = Units Sold x Unit Profit

  * Working hard today and creating value for people to be wealth in 5-10 years.
* Rich people driving Lamborghinis did not get there by getting rich slowly, investing in mutual funds and maxing out 401ks.
* Get rich slowly is bad advice because it takes your entire work life and you have to get lucky with your investments. If you succeed you are too old to enjoy it.
* The 3Fs of being wealth: family, fitness and freedom.
* Fake wealth is having flash stuff you can’t afford which actually take away your freedom and make you dependent.
* Slowlane leave their wealth up to factors they can’t directly control and give up their time for money. Trading time to save money with coupons or deals and working a job.
* Jobs suck because they have no leverage. If you work 50% harder, you don’t get paid 50% more.
* Compound interest only really produces large numbers at the end of the period. $10k = 2.5 mil in 40 years, but it’s only $600k in 30 and $160k in 20.
* Only 10% of $5 mil networth individuals got there through passive investing.
* Way to build wealth quickly: dramatically grow income while controlling expenses.

* Fastlane is producing instead of consuming.
* Consider the size of your market versus the impact you can produce for each person. They are multipliers in business.
* Most industries have standard multiples to determine a business’s value in terms of cash flow. If you increase the profit $1 and your multiple is 10x, you increased the value by $10. Leverage!
* Create a money tree. Something that produces money every month. Real estate, patents, a book, content, distribution systems, money itself even by lending.
* Fastlaners are frugal with time, slowlaners are frugal with money.
