  * Tell your kids to do the same thing
  * Delay retirement to work more
* The problem is what you believe—your script.
* Lies
  * Wealth comes from a great job
  * Snobby people or lucky people are rich
  * Compound interest makes wealth
  * you must follow your passion
  * Starting a business is risky
* The journey starts with a “FUCK THIS” event.
* Financial independence comes from giving value to others
* Productocracy

* Forget passion. Have belief in your product’s value.
* Compound interest really only works when you have a lot of money to begin with
* “You are owned by your shit, which is owned by your debt, which is either owned or profited by a corporation. So you work for a corporation, everything you buy comes from a corporation, everything you watch is produced by a corporation, and the debt you owe is held by a corporation. Ah.”
