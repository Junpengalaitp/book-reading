## 3 Sentence Summary
#### Harkened by the popularity of Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule, famous chess prodigies, and sports superstars, advice to rack up hours of focused, deliberate practice and specialize early has almost been accepted as basic truth – until now. In this persuasive counter-point, David Epstein argues that early specialization is the exception, not the rule. In a wicked world, where we are constantly facing rapidly changing demands, we desperately need people who aren’t afraid to quit and try something new, who think broadly and rely on a breadth of diverse experience to find creative solutions.

## 5 Key Takeaways
1. The world needs both vertical-thinking specialists AND lateral-thinking generalists.
2. An early sampling period is sometimes better than a focused head start.
3. Difficult learning now makes for superior performance later.
4. We learn who we are when we try new things. We learn in practice, not in theory.
5. Don’t be afraid to quit. Persistence for the sake of persistence can get in the way.

## Range Summary
### Specializing is A Case, Not The Rule
* We are often taught that the more competitive and complicated the world gets, the more specialized we all must become to navigate it.
* Roger Federer is the counterpoint to Tiger Woods. Federer grew up playing many different sports and only started concentrating on tennis much later in his teenage years. This is actually the more prevalent path to sports stardom.
* Foregoing a head start to develop range is worth it.

### Kind and Wicked Domains
* “Kind” learning environments are domains in which instinctive pattern recognition is rewarded. Golf and chess are both good examples.
* “Wicked” domains have unclear rules, patterns may not be recognizable, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.
* Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly.

### Creativity
* In open-ended real-world problems, we have a huge advantage over computer AI.
* No savant (someone who has extraordinary abilities in a narrow field) has ever been known to become a “Big-C creator.”
* Creative achievers tend to have broad interests.

### Education
* Modern work demands knowledge transfer: the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and different domains.
* Education should foster critical intelligence, not obsess overspecialization. We must learn how to think before being taught what to think about. Fermi problems are a good example.
* Constrained and repetitive problems are likely to be automated. But there is the potential for huge reward for those who can take conceptual knowledge from one domain and apply it to an entirely new one.
* A sampling period – in lieu of a head start – is integral to the early development of great performers. Narrowed focus and lots of deliberate practice come later.
* The more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models. Then learners become better at applying their knowledge to a new situation. This is the essence of creativity.
* “Hypercorrection effect” – The more confident a learner is of their wrong answer, the better the information sticks when they subsequently learn the right answer. Tolerating big mistakes can create the best learning opportunities.
* Don’t give hints. Let people be wrong. Correcting them later will make the lesson stick.
* If things come easily then you’re not learning. Make it difficult. Make it frustrating.
* The learning road is slow. Doing poorly now is essential for better performance later. Desirable difficulty.

#### Practice
* Interleaving = mixed practice. Don’t do the same scenario in repetition. Helps you match the right strategy to the problem at hand.
* The most successful problem solvers spend mental energy figuring out what type of problem they are facing before matching a strategy to it, rather than jumping in with memorized procedures.
* Look for outside analogies. Find deep structural similarities to the current problem in different ones.
* When generating new ideas or facing novel problems with high uncertainty it’s best to evaluate an array of options before letting intuition take hold.

#### Persistence and When It’s Okay to Quit
* Don’t be afraid to quit. Exploration and switching are necessary to find a good match. Only then should you worry about specializing.
* Quitting isn’t always an admission of failure. Sometimes it’s the sign of astute recognition that better opportunities are available.
* Persistence for the sake of persistence can get in the way.
* Keep an open mind. Take something away from every experience.
* Evaluate yourself for where you are right now. What are your motivations? What would you like to learn? What are your opportunities? Decide on the best match for right now and keep the door open to switch later.
* Fail fast and apply what you learn to the next venture.

#### Finding Your Path
* Our work preferences and our life preferences do not stay the same because we do not stay the same.
Specializing early is a task of predicting match quality for a person who does not exist yet.
* We learn who we are by doing, by trying new activities. We learn in practice, not in theory.
* Test and learn is a better strategy than plan and implement when exploring your career.
Don’t work back from a goal. Work forward from a promising situation.
* “I know who I am when I see what I do.”
* Specialized knowledge can make you blind to all of the possibilities.
Excavate old knowledge but wield it in a new way. Cross-pollinate ideas.
The world needs both vertical-thinking specialists AND lateral-thinking generalists.
* Sometimes more experience makes performance worse. This is especially true in domains that lack automatic feedback. Effective habits of the mind are more important.
* Never rely solely on the data presented. Always ask, “Is this the data we want to make the decision we need to make?” There is danger in reaching conclusions from incomplete data.

#### The Generalist At Work
* The chain of communication has to be informal, completely different from the chain of command. Circular management. Information is allowed to flow in many directions.
* We need to teach people how to think, how to reason.
* Work that builds bridges between disparate pieces of knowledge is less likely to be funded, less likely to appear in famous journals, more likely to be ignored upon publication, and then more likely in the long run to be a smash hit in the library of human knowledge.

#### Moving Forward
* When you push boundaries, the work must be inefficient. That’s okay.
* Don’t feel behind.
* Learn and adjust as you go.
* Experience is never wasted.
* Research in myriad areas suggests that mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power and head starts are overrated.
