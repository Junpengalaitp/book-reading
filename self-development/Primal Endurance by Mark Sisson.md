Primal Endurance focuses on the idea that for distance running and maximizing endurance, a more ketogenic, low carb diet might work best contrary to all the running advice you hear. I personally tried this for some time, but I have to admit that for my ultramarathon training Iâ€™ve been eating a diet much higher in carbohydrates. There are definitely some good ideas in the book and it is backed by some good science and studies. Definitely work considering, especially if you are trying to lose weight.

* You need to slow down and build a good aerobic base before you can really become a good distance runner.
* You need to run really slow in order to train your body to work in the fat burning zone and to teach your body to utilize fat primarily at even faster paces.
* If you restrict carbohydrates and run slow, your body will start to adapt to mostly running off of fat.
* The traditional endurance training approach has several problems:
  * Excess body fat due to dependencies on carbohydrates for fuel
  * Chronic cardio, where the workouts are not effective and also not fully recovered from
* MAF training is a good way to build up your fat burning capacity. It involves very slow training at low heart rate, which progresses over time while the HR stays the same.
  * Look up MAF training for more info
* Nose breathing is the most effective way to breathe at an aerobic pace.
* Build an aerobic base and then build speed on top of it.
* Periodization in training is key to building long lasting endurance and speed.
* Primal eating is mostly removing grains and sugars from the diet.
* Any excess body fat = less carbohydrates.
* Weight loss is difficult through portion control because more running stimulates more appetite.
* Changing hormone levels by reducing insulin works better for weight loss, hence primal eating / endurance.
* Carbohydrate dependency results in fluctuating blood sugar levels and a cycle that is difficult to break.
* Plenty of studies show that an endurance athlete can quickly become fat adapted and deliver performances better than carb fueled athletes.
* Strength training is important to success in endurance sports.
* Sprint exercises for endurance athletes should end when time gets slower.
* HRV or Hearth Rate Variability is an great measure of stress and recovery.
